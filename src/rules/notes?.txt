;; OK, let's sketch the syntax for the function declaration and definition

;; (declare function-name (&rest args-with-optional-param-attrs ???)
;;   (:linkage :private | :internal | :available-externally | ...)
;;   (:visibility :default | :hidden | :protected)
;;   (:dll-storage-class :dllimport | :dllexport)
;;   ((:calling-convention | :cconv) :ccc | (:cc 10) | ...)
;;   (:unnamed-addr t)
;;   (:return-type ??? :parameter-attributes ???)
;;   (:align N)
;;   (:gc "foobar")
;;   (:prefix LLVMConstant)
;;   (:prologue LLVMConstant))


;; (define function-name (&rest args-with-optional-param-attrs ???)
;;   (:linkage :private | :internal | :available-externally | ...)
;;   (:visibility :default | :hidden | :protected)
;;   (:dll-storage-class :dllimport | :dllexport)
;;   ((:calling-convention | :cconv) :ccc | (:cc 10) | ...)
;;   (:unnamed-addr t)
;;   (:return-type ??? :parameter-attributes ???)
;;   (:attributes :alwaysinline :cold (:alignstack N) ...) ; this is listy slot
;;   (:section "name")
;;   (:align N)
;;   (:comdat "$name")
;;   (:gc "foobar")
;;   (:prefix LLVMConstant)
;;   (:prologue LLVMConstant)
;;   (:body list-of-basic blocks)


;; A few things come to mind:
;; * since all functions are global (no lambdas), the llvm-convention of adding @ can be automatic
;; * it seems feasible to really write the back-and-forth translation between lispy, text and clos
;;   representations of at least these function definitions and declarations, not to mention the whole LLVM
;; * as usual, the easiest thing is to start with ESRAP rules for parsing text representation.
